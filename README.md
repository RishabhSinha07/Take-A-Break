# Take-A-Break
WFH can be bad for our body as we sit all day without taking a break, driven deep inside our work. It's better to take small breaks but sometimes we are so much involved with the work that we forgot about that. I tried to fix this problem and created an app that will notify you to take a break every once in a while.
